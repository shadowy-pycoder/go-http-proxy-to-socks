# Explanations for chains taken from /etc/proxychains4.conf
  
# strict - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# all proxies must be online to play in chain
  
# dynamic - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain
# (dead proxies are skipped)

# random - Each connection will be done via random proxy
# (or proxy chain, see  chain_len) from the list.
# this option is good to test your IDS :)

# round_robin - Each connection will be done via chained proxies
# of chain_len length
# all proxies chained in the order as they appear in the list
# at least one proxy must be online to play in chain
# (dead proxies are skipped).
# the start of the current proxy chain is the proxy after the last
# proxy in the previously invoked proxy chain.
# if the end of the proxy chain is reached while looking for proxies
# start at the beginning again.
# These semantics are not guaranteed in a multithreaded environment.

chain:
  type: strict # dynamic, strict, random, round_robin
  length: 2 # maximum number of proxy in a chain (works only for random chain and round_robin chain)
proxy_list:
  - address: 127.0.0.1:1080
    username: username # username and password are optional
    password: password
  - address: 127.0.0.1:1081
  - address: :1082 # empty host means localhost
